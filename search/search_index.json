Studio is the course authoring tool where instructors create and manage course content, structure, and settings (see What Is Studio). The LMS (Learning Management System) is the learner-facing platform where students access courses, view progress, and engage with content.      How can learners access and navigate courses in the LMS?        Learners sign in via the LMS, access their dashboard to view enrolled courses, and navigate through course content, progress tracking, and discussion forums.       follow this: Learner Journey Can I track learner progress and performance on TitanEd?        Log in and go to your Dashboard (see Dashboard and Account Overview).       Click on your enrolled course.       Select the \u201cProgress\u201d tab to view completion status and grades.       Refer to Progress Page Learner Guide.Learner Progress How do I enroll in a course on TitanEd?          Sign in to the LMS at the TitanEd homepage (see LMS Home Page Overview).         Browse available courses or use the search bar.         Click a course to view its \u201cAbout\u201d page.         Click \u201cEnroll\u201d and follow the prompts to confirm.         Refer to Enrolling in Course and Prerequisites.         Learner Enrolling Will I receive a certificate after completing TitanEd\u2019s learning materials?        Certificates are awarded for completing premium courses, not individual learning materials like videos or handouts. To earn a certificate, enroll in a certified course and meet its requirements.      How do I access and review the gradebook for my course?        Log in to the LMS as an instructor.       Select your course from the Dashboard.       Click the \u201cInstructor\u201d tab, then navigate to the \u201cGradebook\u201d or \u201cStudent Admin\u201d section.       View student grades, filter by assignment, or export the gradebook as a CSV file.
