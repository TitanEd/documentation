## Course Import

The Course Import tool allows you to replace the current course content with content from a previously exported course package. This action is permanent and cannot be undone, so proceed with caution.

### Important Considerations Before Importing

- Importing a course **replaces all existing content** in the current course.
- This action **cannot be undone**.
- It is strongly recommended to **export your current course** before proceeding, so you have a backup.

### File Requirements

To import a course, the file must meet the following criteria:

- The file format must be `.tar.gz` (a `.tar` archive compressed using GNU Zip).
- The archive must contain a `course.xml` file at the root level.
- Additional course files may also be included in the archive.

### Import Process Overview

The course import process has **five stages**. During the first two stages, it is important that you **remain on the page** to avoid interruptions.

- You may navigate away **only after the unpacking stage** has completed.
- Even then, it is recommended to **avoid making any changes to the course** until the import process is fully completed.
