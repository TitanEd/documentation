- **Course Title**: Displays the official course title.  
- **Course Title Override**: Optional. Enter an alternate course title to appear on certificates. Leave blank to use the default course title.

### Certificate Signatories

It is strongly recommended to include no more than four signatories to ensure the certificate prints correctly.

For each signatory, provide the following:

- **Name**: The full name as it should appear on the certificate.
- **Title**: The signatory’s title (must be under 100 characters).
- **Organization**: The organization the signatory represents.
- **Signature Image**: Upload **Only PNG** image of the signatory’s signature.

To add more signatories:

- Click **Add additional signatory** and repeat the steps for each additional signer.

After filling out the details, click **Save** to finalize the certificate setup.

> **Tip**: Use the Preview certificate option to how the certificate will appear to learners.

## TitanEd supports the following certificate types:

- **Certificate of Completion**: Issued when a learner completes the course with the required grade.
- **Certificate of Achievement**: Used in professional or advanced learning tracks where more rigorous criteria apply.
- **No Certificate**: Learners can audit the course without receiving certification.

## Customizing Certificates

You can customize certificate appearance and messaging:

- Add your organization’s **logo**.
- Specify **signatory names and titles**.
- Include a **custom course title or subtitle** if different from the default.
- Set the **minimum passing grade** required to earn the certificate.

## Deactivating Certificates

If your course does not require certification, you can easily deactivate certificates using the interface.

### Steps to Deactivate Certificates

1. Log in to TitanEd Studio and open your course.
2. Navigate to the **Settings** menu and select **Certificates**.
3. On the Certificates page, locate the **Deactivate** button in the top-right corner, next to the **Preview Certificate** button.
4. Click **Deactivate** to turn off certificate issuance for the course.
5. Confirm the action if prompted.

After deactivation:

- Learners will no longer receive certificates upon completing the course.
- Previously issued certificates will remain accessible unless revoked manually.

> **Important Note**: Turning off certificates after the course has launched may cause confusion or disappointment for learners. Make sure to communicate the change in advance through course announcements.



## Issuing Certificates

Certificates are automatically issued when a learner:

- Completes all required components.
- Achieves the minimum grade.
- Is enrolled in a certificate-eligible track.

Certificates appear in the learner’s dashboard and can be downloaded as a PDF.

> **Important Note**: Changing certificate settings mid-course may affect learner eligibility. Always review course settings and communicate changes to enrolled learners.

> **Tip**: Preview certificate settings in a test run before your course goes live to ensure layout and eligibility rules are correct.
