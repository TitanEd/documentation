# Subsection Management

Sections, subsections, and units are structured in the course outline:

## Course Progress Information
- A **green check mark** indicates completion of the following:
  - All videos have been viewed.
  - All problems have been answered.
  - HTML content has been viewed for at least 5 seconds.
- The **Resume Course** option takes the learner to the unit they most recently completed.

## Subsections and Visibility to Learners
Learners cannot see content until the subsection's release date has passed and the following conditions are met:
- The **parent section's** release date has passed.
- **Units** within the subsection are published and not hidden.

### Subsection Visibility Options:
- **Default**: Available to learners unless explicitly hidden.
- **Hide Entire Subsection**: Make it completely invisible in course navigation.
- **Hide Content After Date**: Content becomes hidden after the subsection's due date (for instructor-paced courses) or the course's end date (for self-paced courses).

## Release Statuses of Subsections
You control the release status of subsections. Key statuses include:

- **Scheduled with Section**: The subsection is released at the same time as the parent section.
- **Unscheduled**: No content is visible to learners until you set and pass a release date.
- **Scheduled Later than the Section**: The subsection is set to release after the parent sectionâ€™s release date.
- **Released**: The subsection becomes visible to learners once its release date has passed.
