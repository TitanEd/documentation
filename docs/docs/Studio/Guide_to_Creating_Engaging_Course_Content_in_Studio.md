5. (Optional) For compatibility across devices, add alternative video URLs:
   - Below the **Fallback Videos** field, click **Add a Video URL** and enter additional URLs for different encodings or hosting services.
   - Ensure the 360p version of the video is listed first for optimal mobile playback.
6. (Optional) Configure advanced settings, such as playback speed or subtitles, by referring to the **Set Video Settings** documentation.
7. Click **Save** to add the video to the unit.

> **Tip**: Test the video on multiple devices to ensure compatibility and smooth playback. For mobile users, prioritize lower-resolution URLs (e.g., 360p) to reduce buffering.
