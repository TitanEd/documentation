### What Is a Unit?
A unit is a part of a subsection that learners view as a single page.

A unit contains one or more components, such as text with HTML markup, problems, a discussion, or a video.


### Viewing Units in the Outline
The course outline page does not show components. You add or access components by selecting the units that contain the components.

### Viewing the Unit Page
In Studio, when you select a unit name in the outline, the Unit page opens.

### Viewing Units as a Learner
To a learner using the edX learning management system (LMS), each unit in the subsection is represented by an icon in the unit navigation bar at the top of the Course page.

### The Unit Workflow
The typical workflow includes these steps:
- Create a unit
- Add components to the unit
- Modify components in the unit

You publish the unit after you add all of its components. If you make additional modifications, you must publish the unit again for the changes to be visible to learners.

### Unit Publishing Status and Visibility to Learners
The following information summarizes whether or not learners can see a unit:

- **Draft (Never Published)**: Learners never see a unit with this status.
- **Visible to Staff Only**: Learners never see a unit with this status.
- **Published Not Yet Released**: Learners cannot see this unit until the release date (in an instructor-paced course). On the release date, the status changes to Published and Live.
- **Published and Live**: Learners see the current version of the unit.
- **Draft (Unpublished changes)**: Learners see the last published version of the unit if the release dates for the containing section and subsection have passed.

### Unit Publishing Statuses
As a course author, you work with units that have the following statuses:
- Draft (Never Published)
- Published and Live
- Published (Not Yet Released)
- Draft (Unpublished Changes)
- Visible to Staff Only
