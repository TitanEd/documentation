# What Is a Section?

A section is the topmost category in your course. It can represent a time period, chapter, or another organizing principle. A section contains one or more subsections. The levels are:

- Sections
- Subsections
- Units

## Course Progress Information

The course outline shows the learner’s progress. A green check mark indicates that all actions for the section, subsection, or unit have been completed, such as:
- Viewing all videos
- Submitting answers for all problems
- Viewing HTML content for at least 5 seconds

When learners select "Resume Course," the course opens to the unit they most recently completed.

## Sections and Visibility to Learners

Learners cannot see content in a section if its release date is unscheduled or has not passed. If the release date has passed, learners can see the content if:
- The release date for the subsection is passed
- The unit is published and not hidden

## Release Statuses of Sections

Course authors control the release status of sections. For the content to be visible to learners, the section must be released. Possible release statuses are:

- **Unscheduled**: Content is not visible until scheduled.
- **Scheduled**: The section becomes visible after the scheduled release date.
- **Released**: Content is visible if subsections and units are also released.
- **Released with Unpublished Changes**: Learners see the last published version of a unit until changes are published.
- **Staff Only Content**: Hidden from learners, available to the course team only.

## Create a Section

To create a section:
- On the Course Outline page, select "New Section."
