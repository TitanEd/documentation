# What Is a Section?

A section is the topmost category in your course. It can represent a time period, chapter, or another organizing principle. A section contains one or more subsections. The levels are:

- Sections
- Subsections
- Units

## Course Progress Information

The course outline shows the learner’s progress. A green check mark indicates that all actions for the section, subsection, or unit have been completed, such as:
- Viewing all videos
- Submitting answers for all problems
- Viewing HTML content for at least 5 seconds

When learners select "Resume Course," the course opens to the unit they most recently completed.

## Sections and Visibility to Learners

Learners cannot see content in a section if its release date is unscheduled or has not passed. If the release date has passed, learners can see the content if:
- The release date for the subsection is passed
- The unit is published and not hidden

## Release Statuses of Sections

Course authors control the release status of sections. For the content to be visible to learners, the section must be released. Possible release statuses are:

- **Unscheduled**: Content is not visible until scheduled.
- **Scheduled**: The section becomes visible after the scheduled release date.
- **Released**: Content is visible if subsections and units are also released.
- **Released with Unpublished Changes**: Learners see the last published version of a unit until changes are published.
- **Staff Only Content**: Hidden from learners, available to the course team only.

## Create a Section

To create a section:
- On the Course Outline page, select "New Section."
- A new section appears at the end of the course outline.
- Enter a descriptive name for the section and add subsections as needed.

2. The **Settings** window will appear.
3. Input the desired release date and time for the section.

   > **Note**: Times are set in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Use a tool like [Time Zone Converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html) to confirm the correct local time.

4. Click **Save** to apply.

## Hide a Section from Learners
Conceal an entire section, including its subsections and units, from learners, regardless of their individual settings.

For more information, see [Content Visibility](#).

To hide a section:

1. In the section box, select **Configure** from the **Settings** menu.

   ![Section settings icon highlighted](../images/course_s6.png)

2. The **Settings** window opens.
3. Under **Visibility Settings**, check **Hide from learners**.
4. Click **Save**.

The section is now invisible to learners.

To reveal the section, repeat these steps and uncheck **Hide from learners**.

> **Warning**: Making a section visible doesn’t automatically show all its content. Subsections or units explicitly set to hidden, unpublished units, or unshared changes remain inaccessible to learners.


## Set Section Highlights for Highlight Emails

If enabled by the system administrator, highlights of course content can be sent to learners via email. To set highlights:

- Go to the Course Outline page.
- Under the section name, select "Section Highlights."
- Enter 3-5 highlights for the section, each with a maximum of 250 characters.
- Save your changes.

### Send Highlight Emails

Once highlights are set, enable highlight emails:

- On the Course Outline page, find the "Course Highlight Emails" setting.
- Select "Enable Now" and confirm.

   - **Note:** Highlight emails cannot be disabled after enabling.

## Duplicate a Section
Create a copy of a section, including its subsections and units, to reuse or modify content.

1. In the section box, click the **Settings** menu and select **Duplicate**.


2. A new section appears below the original with the same content and settings, typically labeled with a suffix (e.g., "Copy of Section Name").

3. Edit the duplicated section as needed (e.g., rename or modify content).

> **Tip**: Duplicating is useful for reusing similar content across weeks or modules without starting from scratch.

## Move a Section Up or Down
Reorder sections to adjust the course flow.

1. In the section box, click the **Settings** menu.
2. Select **Move Up** to shift the section one position higher in the course outline, or **Move Down** to shift it one position lower.


   > **Note**: The **Move Up** or **Move Down** options are disabled if the section is already at the top or bottom of the course outline.


## Delete a Section
Remove a section and all its subsections and units permanently.

> **Warning**: Deleting a section is irreversible. Confirm you no longer need its content before proceeding.
