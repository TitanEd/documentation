# Course Guidelines

Course information remains true whether the course runs one time or multiple times. This section lists the optional and required information for courses, as well as guidelines to help you create an effective course and About page.

## 1. Course Title Guidelines

When determining the title of your course, consider the following guidelines:

- Use title capitalization and normal spacing and punctuation.
- Limit the course name to 70 characters. Many of the most effective course titles have 50 or fewer characters.
- If the course is part of a sequence, create a title that includes both sequence and course information, formatted as “Sequence: Course”.
- Select a course title that clearly indicates the course subject matter.

**Note**: The title you specify when creating your course becomes part of the course URL. The course URL cannot be changed. However, you can change how the course title appears in Studio and the LMS.

### 1.1 Example Course Titles

- **Stand-alone course**:
  - English Grammar and Essay Writing

- **Course in a sequence**:
  - Circuits and Electronics 1: Basic Circuit Analysis

## 2. Course Number Guidelines

Course numbers have the following guidelines:
- Course numbers can have a maximum of 10 characters.
- Characters can be letters, numbers, or periods.
- If a course consists of several modules, the course number can have an ending such as `.1x` or `.2x`.

**Note**: The number you specify when creating your course becomes part of the course URL. The course URL cannot be changed, but you can change how the course number appears in Studio and the LMS.
