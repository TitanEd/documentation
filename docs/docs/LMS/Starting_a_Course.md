# Starting and Resuming a Course

After enrolling in a course, the next step is to begin learning. This guide explains how to start a course once it becomes available and how to return to where you left off.

## Course Visibility After Enrollment

Once you enroll in a course:

- The course appears on your **dashboard**
- You will see the **course title**, **instructor/organization name**, and the **start date**

> **Note**: You can enroll in a course before it begins. However, you will not be able to access any course materials until the official start date has passed.

### To Start a Course:

1. Go to your dashboard  
2. Locate the course you want to begin  
3. Click **View Course**  
4. You will be taken to the **Course Page**

On the Course Page:

- You may see a **welcome message** from the course team
- At the top of the outline, you'll find a **Start Course** button

> **Tip:**Taking the tour is optional, but it's a great way to quickly understand the layout and get comfortable before you start learning.


Click **Start Course** to begin at the very first section.  
Alternatively, you can open any section by expanding the outline and selecting a topic of your choice.

> **Resuming a Course:**
When you return to a course later, you don’t need to remember where you left off. There are convenient ways to resume learning.

- Select **Resume your last course**  
- The platform will take you directly to the last unit you completed

### Resume a Specific Course

You have two ways to resume a specific course:

#### From the Dashboard:
- Find the course you want to continue
- Click **Resume Course**

#### From Within the Course:
- Open the course normally
- Click **Resume Course** on the Course Page

You will be taken to the **last unit** you completed in that course.

### Understanding Prerequisite Messages

![Prerequisite](../images/lms_s9.png)

If you see this message:

> This section is a prerequisite. You must complete this section in order to unlock additional content.

It means that you need to complete the required sections in order, step-by-step.

You cannot access or complete later sections until you finish all previous ones.

This helps you build knowledge progressively and ensures you don’t miss important information.

---

## How Completion is Tracked

A unit is marked as **complete** when all the following actions are done:

- All videos have been watched  
- All questions or problems have been attempted or submitted  
- All text and content have been viewed for at least five seconds

Once a section is complete, a **green check mark** appears in the course outline next to that unit.

This helps you easily track your learning progress and know what’s next.
