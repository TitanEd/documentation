# Course Prerequisites and Entrance Exams

Some courses have certain requirements that learners must meet before they can access course content. These requirements are in place to make sure learners are prepared and have the foundational knowledge needed for success in the course.

This document explains two common types of course requirements:

- Prerequisite Courses  
- Entrance Exams

---

## Prerequisite Courses

Some courses require that you complete another course first. This is called a **prerequisite course**. The purpose is to ensure you have the necessary background knowledge before moving forward.

### Where to Find Prerequisite Info

You can usually find information about prerequisites on the **About** page of the course. The page will tell you if:

- You need specific skills or knowledge  
- You need to complete a different course first  

### What Happens If You Enroll Without Completing the Prerequisite

You can still enroll in the course even if you haven’t completed the required course. However:

- The course will appear on your dashboard  
- You **will not** be able to access the content yet  
- A message will be shown under the course name that says you must complete the prerequisite first  
- A link will be provided to the required course

> **Example**  
> If you want to take a “Math Basics” course but it requires a “Science Foundations” course as a prerequisite, you'll need to complete the Science course first. You can enroll in Math, but you won’t be able to enter the course until the Science course is completed.

### How to Complete the Prerequisite

1. Click the link to the prerequisite course from your dashboard  
2. Enroll in the prerequisite course  
3. Complete the required materials  
4. Once completed, the original course becomes available on your dashboard  
5. You can now enter and start learning

---

## Entrance Exams

Some courses require learners to pass an entrance exam before gaining full access to course content.

### How Entrance Exams Work

- After enrolling, the course appears on your dashboard  
- You will **not** see all course content until the exam is passed  
- The first time you enter the course, you will be taken to the **Entrance Exam page**

On this page, you will see:

- Your current score  
- The minimum score needed to pass  
- Instructions to start the exam

### Taking the Exam

1. Answer all the questions  
2. Click **Submit** to send your answers  
3. Refresh the page to see your score  
4. The top of the page will tell you whether you passed  
   - If you refresh before finishing, it will show your current score

Once you pass:

- All available course materials will become visible  
- You can start working through the course

> **Note**  
> In some cases, the course team may allow you to skip the entrance exam. If this is allowed, you will gain access to all course content immediately after enrollment.

---


> Some courses may have both types of requirements. Always read the **About** page of the course carefully to understand what is needed before you begin.
