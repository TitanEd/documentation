## Extensions

This section allows instructors to grant due date extensions for graded subsections to individual learners.

### Important Notes

- You can only **extend** due dates — not shorten them.
- The system always uses the **latest applicable due date** for a learner.
- Extensions apply to specific graded subsections only.
