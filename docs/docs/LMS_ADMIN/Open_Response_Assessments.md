## Open Response Assessment (ORA) Overview and Setup Guide

The Open Response Assessment (ORA) allows learners to answer open-ended questions in essay form or upload files as part of their response. Responses are then graded by learners themselves, their peers, course instructors, or a combination of the three.

There are many ways to configure an ORA. This article provides a quick overview of the problem type so you can get up and running.

## Creating an Open Response Assessment

1. From Studio, navigate to the course unit where you want to add the ORA.
2. At the bottom of the unit, click **Add New Component** > **Problem** > **Open Response Assessment**.

> **Note:** You will see both the terms *Peer Assessment* and *Open Response Assessment* used interchangeably. At Appsembler, we use *Open Response Assessment* to avoid confusion.

3. You will see a demo version of the ORA. Click the **Edit** button to begin making changes.

## Configuring the Rubric

The rubric defines how learners' responses are graded.

- A rubric consists of **Criteria** — characteristics a learner's response should include.
- Each **Criterion** has a set of **Options**, describing how well the response meets that criterion (e.g., Poor, Fair, Good).
- Each option has a point value assigned.

### Setting up Criteria and Options

- Each criterion requires a **name** and a **description**.
- Under each criterion, add options with:
  - Option name
  - Explanation
  - Assigned points
- You can add more options as needed.
- Choose whether written feedback is **optional** or **required** for each criterion.

Once your rubric is complete, click **Settings** to finish setting up the ORA.

In the **Settings** panel, you can configure:

- The **name** of the ORA and the **availability dates** for submissions.
- Whether learners are allowed to upload **files** or include **LaTeX** in their responses.  
  *(See documentation on allowing file uploads for details.)*

### Learner Steps Configuration

Choose which optional steps learners will take by checking/unchecking:

- **Learner Training**  
  Learners see a sample response and how it should be graded.

- **Peer Assessment**  
  Learners assess one another's responses using the rubric.

- **Self Assessment**  
  Learners assess their own responses using the rubric.

- **Staff Assessment**  
  Course staff assess learner responses using the rubric.

> For example, you might enable only **Staff Assessment** if staff grading is preferred.

## Responding to an ORA (Learner View)

Once an ORA is live, learners will see the prompt and submission interface.

- When waiting for feedback, the system will show a **waiting status**.

## Grading an ORA (Staff View)

Staff can navigate to the ORA component to review and grade learner responses:

- Staff read submitted responses.
- Staff provide feedback per the rubric.
- Staff can choose to:
  - Submit the assessment and finish grading this response.

## Understanding Grading Status

Each response has a grading status that indicates its current state:

- **Ungraded**: The submission has not yet been graded.
- **Grading Completed**: The grading is finalized and a score is assigned.
- **Currently being graded by someone else**: Another staff member is grading the response.
- **You are currently grading this response**: You have opened and started grading this response.
